# Step 4_2 Add jenkins pipelines

# General Tips

- Sort you pipelines a bit e.g. via folders if you have more of them
- a good start is:
    -  a folder for "prod" pipelines (that should never fail) 
    -  a folder for "dev" pipelines (that might break)
    -  that way you can quickly chjeck what is and what isnt broken
- you can create folder via "New Item" --> "Folder"

# Adding a Pipeline

- Navigate to jenkins home
- click on "New Item" top left
- enter your pipeline name e.g. "weekly_nextcloud_update"
- click Pipeline
- click ok
- the settings for each pipeline can always be a bit different depending on your needs
- the general GUi gives nice hints, here is a sensible default for many "housekeeping" style pipelines(e.g. patches):
    - [ x ] Discard old builds
        - [90] Days to keep builds
    - [ ] Do not allow concurrent builds
        - [ ] abort previous builds
    - [ ] Do not allow the pipeline to resume if the controller restarts
    - [ ] GitHub project
    - [ ] Pipeline speed/durability override
    - [ ] Preserve stashes from completed builds
    - [ ] This project is parameterized
    - [ ] Throttle builds
    - Triggers
        - [ ] Build after other projects are built
        - [ x ] Build periodically
            - [ H 2 * * 0 ] (see section Schedule) 
        - [ ] Build when job nodes start
        - [ ] GitHub hook trigger for GITScm polling
        - [ ] Poll SCM
        - [ ] Trigger builds remotely (e.g., from scripts)

- In the pipeline section, add the relevant pipelines
- You can find some examples here:
- [scripts/step_5/pipelines](../scripts/step_5/pipelines)

# Schedule

Here you can enter cronjob syntax to configure the pipeline.
This tells jenkins when to run this job.
See also: https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/syntax/#cron-syntax
Here some examples: 
```bash
H 2 * * 0  # every sunday 2AM
25 * * * * # every hour at 25 min mark
5 12 2 * * # every second of a month at 12:05
```

# Advanced Tip

- you can also maintain your pipelines directly in git
- this is awesome, but a bit more complicated in the initial setup
- therefore we have omitted it here, but you can read on it here for example:
